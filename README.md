# Fake News Detection 📰

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model analyzes the textual content of news articles and classifies them as **real** or **fake** based on linguistic patterns.

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques  
- Machine learning models for classification  
- Model evaluation using accuracy and other metrics  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK / SpaCy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset
